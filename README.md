highlightJS
===========

playing with highlight.js

this is just a kind of demo for me using highlight.js.  Im also trying to get is so that a file can be read into the black square and
the highlight.js applied to it.  

The working version is currently hosted at babbage.cs.missouri.edu/~sggtgb.highlightJS/test.html
